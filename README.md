## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Best Practices

### üìê Design Patterns
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Predictable state management
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data layer abstraction
- **Dependency Injection Ready**: Structured for DI frameworks

### üéõÔ∏è State Management
- **Jetpack Compose State**: Reactive UI updates with `StateFlow`
- **ViewModel Lifecycle**: Proper lifecycle-aware components
- **Immutable Data Classes**: Predictable state mutations
- **Coroutines**: Asynchronous operations and animations
